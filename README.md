# terminal style portfolio

I decided to create a terminal style portfolio after seeing some examples of them online.

To me, a lot of them seemed overcomplicated using various frameworks to achieve similar results.

Initially I intended to create one using Bootstrap but decided vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was the way to go. Although Bootstrap is still structuring the page slightly, its link is able to be removed from the HTML.
